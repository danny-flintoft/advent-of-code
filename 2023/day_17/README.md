Runs for part 1 but too slow to actually process for part 2 on the input data (works on test data), need to revisite!

Uses [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) with multiple states, each "node" tracks position, direction, and moves travelled, to account for the move limitations.
